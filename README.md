## Notes

I faced a lot of challenges while building this app, including the app not working due to an app delegate error which I am currently trying to fix. I have tried using multiple resources and I am still working on the app to make it better. I am also trying to make the app functional as the logic I have implemented to make the app work is correct but the app is not working as needed.
